His contributions have been recognized with the Charles Stark Draper Prize of the National Academy of Engineering 1 “for the vision, conception, and development of the first practical networked personal computers,” the Alan. M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery “for pioneering many of the ideas at the root of contemporary object-oriented programming languages, leading the team that developed Smalltalk,and for fundamental contributions to personal computing,” and the Kyoto Prize from the Inamori Foundation “for creation of the concept of modern personal computing and contribution to its realization.” This work was done in the rich context of ARPA and Xerox PARC with many talented colleagues. While at the ARPA project at the University of Utah in the late 60s, he invented dynamic object-oriented programming2, was part of the original team that developed continuous tone 3D graphics, was the co-designer of the FLEXMachine3, an early desktop computer with graphical user interface and object-oriented operating system, participated in the design of the ARPAnet, and inspired by children4, conceived the Dynabook, a laptop personal computer for children of all ages.
    <p  style='padding-bottom: 10px;'></p>
    At the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the Early 70's he invented Smalltalk, the first completely object-oriented programming, authoring and operating system (which included the now ubiquitous overlapping window interface), instigated the bit-map screen, screen painting and animation, participated in desk-top publishing, other desk-top media, and the development of the Alto1, the first modern networked personal computer. This was part of the larger process at PARC that created an entire genre of personal computing including: the GUI, Ethernet, Laser printing, modern word processing,client-servers and peer-peer networking.
    <p  style='padding-bottom: 10px;'></p>
    He has a BA in Mathematics and Biology with minor concentrations in English and Anthropology from the University of Colorado, 1966.
